<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently an undergraduate student at Stanford University with a keen interest in artificial intelligence and its interdisciplinary applications. My projects have explored diverse topics such as evaluating deepfake detection techniques and developing optical character recognition systems tailored for French literature. I am particularly passionate about ensuring AI is deployed responsibly and effectively, emphasizing user-centered design and ethical considerations. This interest has also drawn me toward product management, where I strive to align technological advancements with meaningful solutions that address real user needs.
